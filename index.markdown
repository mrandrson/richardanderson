    <p>My name is Richard Anderson, and I am in my last year as a Mathematics and Physics Undergraduate at The University of Texas at El Paso. I have 3 cumulative years of research experience, having worked on projects in theoretical astrophysics, computational particle physics, applications of machine learning to computer vision in aerospace engineering, and effective field theory simulations. You can view my resume <a href="{{ '/assets/files/resume.pdf' | relative_url }}">here</a>.</p>
